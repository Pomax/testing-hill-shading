- learn how ECR works?
  - how to get a container into ECR
  - how to get *our* container into ECR using our build process
    - terraform scripts/work

  - how to then install from ECR

- Glitch repo has ECR branches to look at
- expectation = you have to set up replication needs to exist before the repo can be run. don't think we can do that after the fact.

eng. meeting

1. move sequelize to post-ECR work, rewrite as epic?
2. ECR
   - 

- placeProject (project pacement service ts)
  - subrole is "split" or default (xenial?)
  - actual container gets built by swarm-forwarder (little proxy) by being told to do so by BigProxy
    - which docker container to send to, or which container image to build
    - right now, one docker host only knows one docker image
